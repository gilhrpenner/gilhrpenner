👨‍💻 **About Me**

🎓 B.Sc. Computer Science (Co-op), **University of Manitoba**  
🌐 Mission: **democratize the internet** with UI/UX that actually respects humans (and keyboards)  
🧠 I like building products that feel simple on the outside and mildly unhinged (in a good way) on the inside

---

🧰 **Currently obsessed with**

- ⚡ **Convex** (reactive everything, fewer tears)
- 🧪 **TanStack Start** (because routing should not be a side quest)
- 🧱 TypeScript (my emotional support compiler)
- 🎨 Accessibility + inclusive design (shipping is cool, shipping for everyone is cooler)

---

🧪 **Tech Stack I reach for**

- **Frontend:** React, React Native, Vue, Svelte-ish??
- **Backend:** Convex, tRPC, Next.js (yes, I collect backends like Pokémon)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is my bae 🩷
- **Infra vibes:** serverless-ish, queues/jobs, webhooks, “pls don’t wake me up at 3am” reliability

---

🚀 **What I like building**

- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms with real permissions (not “admin = god mode”)
- Workflow tooling, dashboards, Kanban, automations, integrations
- Anything that turns messy processes into clean UIs

---

🌈 **Fun Facts**

- I have a soft spot for **Tesla, AI/ML, and Settlers of Catan** 🚗🤖
- Favorite color: **purple** 💜 so is my Tesla ;)
- I will refactor “later” (narrator: later becomes a full rewrite)
